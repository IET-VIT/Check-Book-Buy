# Check-Book-Buy

## ðŸ“„ Abstract
The demand of basic necessities prevails over their supply during such a time of a global pandemic. People have to get general daily items like food and medicine and sometimes the items might not be available in that particular shop and thereby risking themselves by staying out more and getting affected by the virus. I propose a platform to acquire and share data between two most significant parties in the supply chain that is the buyer and the seller. A web portal that will connect the shopkeepers and the customers. The seller needs to feed the stock data and the buyer his requirements on this portal. This data is then uploaded to the database from which a network is created between different buyers and sellers.
